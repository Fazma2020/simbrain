/**
 * Update all components and couplings as follows. First update couplings using
 * a buffering system whereby the order in which they are updated does not
 * matter (read all producer values, write them to a buffer, then read all
 * buffer values and write them to the consumers). Then update all the
 * components.
 *
 * In workspace updater, the following happens. Each component update call is
 * fed to an executor service which uses as many threads as it's configured to
 * use (it defaults to the number of available processors which can be changed.)
 * Then the executing thread waits on a countdown latch. Each component update
 * decrements the latch so that after the last update is complete, the thread
 * waiting on the latch wakes up and updates all the couplings.
